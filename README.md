# triggered

Triggered is a slightly ironic Chrome plugin which removes content from web pages based on triggering words inputted by the user.

It is still in development, and currently only works well with content inside `div` tags. In future it will remove based on more DOM elements and on image metadata.

It has custom remove rules for Facebook, removing the entire post as opposed to some subsection of the post. It is my plan to implement this sort of behaviour for other websites (e.g. Tumblr) in future.
